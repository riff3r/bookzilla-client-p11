        <h2 className="mb-4">Difference between javascript and nodejs?</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a programming language that runs in any browser
          JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running
          environment for a JavaScript programming language
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript is normally used for any client-side activity for one web
          application. Whereas Node JS mainly used for accessing or running any
          operating system for non-blocking operation.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript running in any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox),
          JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome). Whereas Node JS only
          support the V8 engine, which googles chrome specific.

          When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that
          offers basic programming tools/support and can compile and/or
          interpret code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming
          language. So, if we want to write some kind of stand-alone program or
          server in Javascript, then we can use nodejs for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If application needs the ability to persistently store data in a way
          that you can efficiently query or update it later, then you would
          typically use some form of database. NoSQL databases like MongoDB are
          a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesnâ€™t fit well
          into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate
          massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use
          cases.

        <h2 className="mb-4">Differences between sql and nosql databases? </h2>
        <p>SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.</p>

        <p>
          SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined
          schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are
          horizontally scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document,
          key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is
          better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
